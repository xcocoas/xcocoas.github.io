# Privacy Policy (Updated Version)  


### 1. Data Collection Scope  
1. **Only Network for Subscription Verification**: When purchasing a subscription, the app will connect to the network to verify the order status with Apple's payment system. This process only transmits necessary transaction information (such as order number and product ID), without involving personal identifiable information like name or phone number.  
2. **Local Data Processing**: Data for other functions (e.g., [specific function example]) is only stored locally on the device and will not be uploaded online, such as cached files or setting preferences.  


### 2. Explanation of Network Activities  
- Networking is solely used for in-app purchase verification through Apple, adhering to the payment guidelines of the Apple App Store. Data is only used to confirm transaction validity and will not be used for other purposes or associated with personal information.  


### 3. Core Privacy Principles  
- **No Collection of Personal Information**: Except for transaction information necessary for subscription verification, we do not obtain personally identifiable data such as location, contact lists, or browsing history.  
- **No Data Sharing**: Neither local data nor subscription verification information will be shared with third parties (e.g., advertisers or data companies), and only necessary interactions are completed within Apple's payment system.  


### 4. Supplementary Notes  
- The networking behavior for subscription verification is led by Apple's payment system. We only receive verification results and do not store your payment account or financial details.  
- The security of local data relies on protection measures such as device passwords. It is recommended to keep the system updated to enhance security.  


**Note**: This version includes descriptions of networking scenarios. When submitting for review, ensure compliance with Apple's specifications for subscription verification and supplement developer information and policy update dates.
